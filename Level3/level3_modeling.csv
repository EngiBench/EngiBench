Multiple approaches can be used to support decision-making and to determine a reasonable sampling scheme that minimizes the sample size as much as possible.
The result should clearly present the relationship between the sample size and the number of defective items. This relationship can be shown in tables or curves. At a minimum, provide the number of samples to be inspected and the maximum number of defective items that would still allow the batch to be accepted (or the minimum number that would lead to rejection).

When the batch size is small, sampling follows a hypergeometric distribution. When the batch size is large, a binomial distribution approximation can be used. For large sample sizes, a normal distribution approximation may be applied. Therefore, when providing the sampling plan, the underlying assumptions must be clearly stated. Directly applying a normal distribution without explicitly stating the assumptions is inappropriate.

This problem requires a clear explanation of the decision-making basis and the definition of relevant quantitative metrics, such as expected cost, revenue, or profit. Mathematical models should be constructed for different decision scenarios, and these models must be capable of handling various cases.

The following methods (not limited to these) can be used to build and solve the model:

Theoretical Analysis – provide analytical expressions and solutions.

Simulation-Based Methods – ensure that the simulation results include reliability analysis.

Regardless of the modeling approach, a detailed analysis process must be provided, along with a clear presentation of the results.

It is encouraged to propose hypotheses or strategies that simplify the solution process. For instance, in Scenario 6, due to high disassembly costs, the correct strategy for defective products is not to disassemble. In other scenarios, disassembly may lead to higher returns. It's important to note that if a part has already been inspected, it does not need to be re-inspected after disassembly. If the disassembled part has not been previously inspected (or if inspection results are not recorded), the conditional probability of the part being defective must be recalculated.

"  应用深水炸弹(简称深弹)反潜，曾是二战时期反潜的重要手段，而随着现代军事技术的发展，鱼雷已成为现代反潜作战的主要武器。但是，在海峡或浅海等海底地形较为复杂的海域，由于价格低、抗干扰能力强，仍有一些国家在研究和发展深水炸弹反潜技术。  

反潜飞机攻击水下目标前，先由侦察飞机通过电子侦察设备发现水下潜艇目标的大致位置，然后召唤反潜飞机前来进行攻击。当潜艇发现被侦察飞机电子设备跟踪时，通常会立即关闭电子设备及发动机，采取静默方式就地隐蔽。  

本问题采用目标坐标系：潜艇中心位置的定位值在海平面上的投影为原点 \(O\)，正东方向为 \(X\) 轴正向，正南方向为 \(Y\) 轴正向，垂直于海平面向下方向为 \(Z\) 轴正向。正北方向顺时针旋转到潜艇航向的方位角记为 \(\beta\)，假定在一定条件下反潜攻击方可获知该航向(见图1)。  

**图1关键信息描述**：  
1. 水平面坐标系中，潜艇航向方位角 \(\beta\) 以正北为基准顺时针标定  
2. \(X/Y\) 轴方向的正态分布误差范围示意  
3. 潜艇主体简化为长方体并标注航向关系  

由于存在定位误差，潜艇中心实际位置的3个坐标是相互独立的随机变量，其中 \(X\)，\(Y\) 均服从正态分布 \(N(0, \sigma^2)\)，\(Z\) 服从单边截尾正态分布 \(N(h_0, \sigma_z^2, l)\)，其密度函数为  
\[
f_{h_0, \sigma_z, l}(v)=\frac{1}{\sigma_z} \cdot \frac{\phi\left(\frac{v-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)}{1-\Phi\left(\frac{l-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)} \quad (l<v<+\infty),
\]  
这里 \(h_0\) 是潜艇中心位置深度的定位值，\(l\) 是潜艇中心位置实际深度的最小值，\(\phi\) 和 \(\Phi\) 分别是标准正态分布的密度函数与分布函数。  

将潜艇主体部分简化为长方体，深弹在水中垂直下降。假定深弹采用双引信(触发引信+定深引信)引爆，定深引信事先设定引爆深度，深弹在海水中的最大杀伤距离称为杀伤半径。深弹满足以下情形之一，视为命中潜艇：  
1. 航空深弹落点在目标平面尺度范围内，且引爆深度位于潜艇上表面的下方，由触发引信引爆；  
2. 航空深弹落点在目标平面尺度范围内，且引爆深度位于潜艇上表面的上方，同时潜艇在深弹的杀伤范围内，由定深引信引爆；  
3. 航空深弹落点在目标平面尺度范围外，则到达引爆深度时，由定深引信引爆，且此时潜艇在深弹的杀伤范围内。  

请建立数学模型，解决以下问题： ","Depth charges (referred to as depth bombs) were critical anti-submarine weapons during World War II. With the development of modern military technology, torpedoes have become the primary weapons in contemporary anti-submarine warfare. However, in complex sea terrains such as straits and shallow waters, some countries continue to research and develop depth charge technology due to its low cost and strong anti-jamming capabilities.  

Before attacking underwater targets, anti-submarine aircraft are typically guided by reconnaissance aircraft that detect the approximate location of submarines using electronic surveillance equipment. When submarines detect electronic tracking by reconnaissance aircraft, they usually immediately shut down electronic devices and engines, adopting silent mode for concealment.  

This problem adopts the target coordinate system:  
- The projection of the submarine's center position onto the sea surface is the origin \(O\)  
- East direction is the positive \(X\)-axis  
- South direction is the positive \(Y\)-axis  
- Downward direction perpendicular to the sea surface is the positive \(Z\)-axis  
- The heading angle \(\beta\) is defined as the clockwise rotation from true north to the submarine's direction (see Figure 1).  

**Key Information in Figure 1**:  
1. In the horizontal coordinate system, the submarine's heading angle \(\beta\) is measured clockwise from true north.  
2. Normal distribution error ranges along the \(X/Y\)-axes.  
3. Submarine body is simplified as a rectangular prism with annotated heading relationships.  

Due to positioning errors, the submarine's actual center coordinates are independent random variables:  
- \(X\) and \(Y\) follow normal distribution \(N(0, \sigma^2)\)  
- \(Z\) follows a one-sided truncated normal distribution \(N(h_0, \sigma_z^2, l)\) with density function:  
\[
f_{h_0, \sigma_z, l}(v)=\frac{1}{\sigma_z} \cdot \frac{\phi\left(\frac{v-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)}{1-\Phi\left(\frac{l-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)} \quad (l<v<+\infty),
\]  
where \(h_0\) is the depth positioning value, \(l\) is the minimum actual depth, \(\phi\) and \(\Phi\) are the standard normal PDF and CDF, respectively.  

The submarine body is simplified as a rectangular prism. Depth charges descend vertically underwater using dual fuzes (contact fuze + depth fuze). The depth fuze is preset to detonate at a specific depth, and the maximum lethal distance underwater is defined as the kill radius. A hit is confirmed if any of the following conditions are met:  
1. The depth charge lands within the submarine's horizontal dimensions, and detonation depth is below the submarine's upper surface (contact fuze activation).  
2. The depth charge lands within the submarine's horizontal dimensions, detonation depth is above the submarine's upper surface, and the submarine is within the kill radius (depth fuze activation).  
3. The depth charge lands outside the submarine's horizontal dimensions, but the submarine is within the kill radius at the preset detonation depth (depth fuze activation).  ","## Background Context

本要点仅供参考，各赛区评阅组应根据对题目的理解及学生的解答，自主地进行评阅。

本问题讨论反潜艇空深弹的命中概率问题。主要考察学生正确运用概率分布原理求深弹命中概率的数学表达式，以及运用数值积分求解相应概率值。

## 问题1
设潜艇长、宽、高分别为 \( A, B, H \)，引爆深度为 \( h \)，杀伤半径为 \( d \)。由于潜艇中心平面定位分布为中心对称分布，故潜艇航向不影响命中概率，所以不妨设潜艇航向为正东，即 \( \beta = 90^\circ \)。

### 建立深弹毁伤区域与引爆深度 \( h \) 的关系
当潜艇的中心位置平面坐标 \( O' (x,y) \) 位于某平面区域时，潜艇将受到毁伤，该平面区域 \( E \) 称为深弹毁伤平面区域，深弹命中潜艇的概率为 \( P((x,y) \in E) \)。要求此概率，首先要写出毁伤平面区域 \( E \) 与引爆深度 \( h \) 之间的关系。可分析得出结论：毁伤平面区域 \( S_r \) 为图1中左图的圆角矩形区域，其中 \( r = \sqrt{d^2 - (h_0 - H/2 - h)^2} \)，图1中右图为三维毁伤区域示意图。

**图1关键信息描述**：
- 左图：毁伤平面区域 \( S_r \) 示意图（\( Q \) 点为投弹落点平面坐标），呈现圆角矩形形状，中心对称。
- 右图：三维毁伤区域示意图，展示圆柱形杀伤范围与潜艇的空间关系。

- **落点及引爆深度与最大命中概率的关系分析**  
  可通过分析得出结论：当落点平面坐标 \((x_0, y_0) = (0.0)\)，\( h \in [h_0 - H/2, h_0 + H/2]\) 时，深弹命中潜艇的概率最大。

- **概率表达式**  
  当 \((x_0, y_0) = (0.0)\)，\( h \in [h_0 - H/2, h_0 + H/2]\) 时毁伤区域 \( S_d \) 面积最大，深弹命中潜艇的最大概率的一种表达式如下，其它形式的表达式可参照此式判断：

\[P((x,y) \in S_d) = \iint_{S_d} \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x^2 + y^2)\right) dy \, dx\]

\[= 4\left(\Phi\left(\frac{A/2 + d}{\sigma}\right) - 0.5\right)\left(\Phi\left(\frac{B/2 + d}{\sigma}\right) - 0.5\right)\]

\[-4\left(\frac{\frac{A/2 + d}{\sigma}}{A/2\sigma}\right)\Phi\left(\frac{B/2 + d}{\sigma}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{\sqrt{d^2 - (x - A/2)^2} + B/2}{\sigma}\right)\Phi(x) \, dx\]

- **概率计算**  
  当深弹的落点平面坐标取为 \((0,0)\)，引爆深度取为区间 \([150 - 12.5, 150 + 12.5]\) 中任一点时，应用数值积分，得计算结果：潜艇被命中的概率参考区间为 \((0.08, 0.09)\)。  
  也可用蒙特卡洛方法直接计算概率，但需说明随机取点个数，取点个数较小时，计算误差较大。","# 2024 Higher Education Society Cup National College Students Mathematical Modeling Competition Problem D Grading Guidelines

These guidelines are for reference only. Each regional evaluation panel should conduct assessments independently based on their understanding of the problem and student solutions.

This problem discusses the hit probability analysis of anti-submarine aviation depth charges. It primarily evaluates students' ability to correctly derive mathematical expressions for hit probability using probability distribution principles and to solve corresponding probability values using numerical integration.

---

## Problem 1  
Let the submarine's length, width, and height be \( A, B, H \) respectively, with detonation depth \( h \) and kill radius \( d \). Since the submarine's planar positioning distribution is centrally symmetric, its heading does not affect hit probability. Assume the submarine's heading is due east (\(\beta = 90^\circ\)).

### Relationship Between Damage Zone and Detonation Depth \( h \)  
When the submarine's center coordinates \( O'(x,y) \) lie within a planar region \( E \), the submarine is damaged. This region \( E \) is called the depth charge's damage zone. The hit probability \( P((x,y) \in E) \) requires analyzing the relationship between \( E \) and \( h \). Key findings:  
- Damage zone \( S_r \) is a rounded rectangle (left subfigure in Fig. 1) with radius \( r = \sqrt{d^2 - (h_0 - H/2 - h)^2} \).  
- Right subfigure in Fig. 1 shows a 3D damage zone schematic.  

**Key Information in Figure 1**:  
- Left: Damage planar zone \( S_r \) (drop point \( Q \)) as a rounded rectangle with central symmetry.  
- Right: 3D damage zone showing cylindrical kill range and submarine spatial relationship.  

#### Analysis of Maximum Hit Probability  
- **Optimal Drop Point**: When \((x_0, y_0) = (0,0)\) and \( h \in [h_0 - H/2, h_0 + H/2] \), hit probability reaches maximum.  
- **Probability Expression**:  
\[
P((x,y) \in S_d) = \iint_{S_d} \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x^2 + y^2)\right) dy \, dx
\]
\[
= 4\left(\Phi\left(\frac{A/2 + d}{\sigma}\right) - 0.5\right)\left(\Phi\left(\frac{B/2 + d}{\sigma}\right) - 0.5\right)
\]
\[
-4\int_{0}^{\frac{A/2 + d}{\sigma}} \left[ \Phi\left(\frac{B/2 + d}{\sigma}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{\sqrt{d^2 - (\sigma x - A/2)^2} + B/2}{\sigma} \right) \right] dx
\]

#### Numerical Results  
Using numerical integration for \((x_0, y_0) = (0,0)\) and \( h \in [150 - 12.5, 150 + 12.5] \):  
- Hit probability reference range: \( (0.08, 0.09) \).  
- Monte Carlo methods require sufficient sampling points to avoid large errors.

1. **Contact detonation**:  
   - Charge lands within submarine's horizontal dimensions  
   - Detonation depth ≥ submarine's upper surface  
2. **Depth-triggered detonation (in-range)**:

## Problem 2  
#### Probability Expression  
Let submarine depth be \( z \). Conditional hit probability given \( z \):  
\[
P(E|z) = 4 \left( \Phi \left( \frac{A/2 + r}{\sigma} \right) - 0.5 \right) \left( \Phi \left( \frac{B/2 + r}{\sigma} \right) - 0.5 \right)
\]
\[
-4 \int_{0}^{\frac{A/2 + r}{\sigma}} \left[ \Phi \left( \frac{B/2 + r}{\sigma} \right) - \Phi \left( \frac{\sqrt{r^2 - (\sigma x - A/2)^2} + B/2}{\sigma} \right) \right] dx
\]
where  
\[
r = 
\begin{cases} 
\sqrt{d^2 - (h - z - H/2)^2} & \text{if } z \in [h - d - H/2, h - H/2) \\
d & \text{if } z \in [h - H/2, h + H/2] \\
\sqrt{d^2 - (z - H/2 - h)^2} & \text{if } z \in (h + H/2, h + d + H/2]
\end{cases}
\]

Total hit probability:  
\[
P(E) = \int_{h - d - H/2}^{h + d + H/2} P(E|z)f(z; h_0, \sigma_z^2, l) \, dz
\]

#### Optimization Methods  
1. **Grid Search**: Compute \( P(E) \) via numerical integration for varying \( h \).  
2. **Monte Carlo**: Requires large sample sizes for accuracy.  
3. **Penalty**: Solutions assuming \( h = h_0 \) or \( h = \mathbb{E}[z] \) receive reduced scores.  

#### Reference Results  
- Optimal \( h \): \( (152m, 153m) \)

"应用深水炸弹(简称深弹)反潜，曾是二战时期反潜的重要手段，而随着现代军事技术的发展，鱼雷已成为现代反潜作战的主要武器。但是，在海峡或浅海等海底地形较为复杂的海域，由于价格低、抗干扰能力强，仍有一些国家在研究和发展深水炸弹反潜技术。  

反潜飞机攻击水下目标前，先由侦察飞机通过电子侦察设备发现水下潜艇目标的大致位置，然后召唤反潜飞机前来进行攻击。当潜艇发现被侦察飞机电子设备跟踪时，通常会立即关闭电子设备及发动机，采取静默方式就地隐蔽。  

本问题采用目标坐标系：潜艇中心位置的定位值在海平面上的投影为原点 \(O\)，正东方向为 \(X\) 轴正向，正南方向为 \(Y\) 轴正向，垂直于海平面向下方向为 \(Z\) 轴正向。正北方向顺时针旋转到潜艇航向的方位角记为 \(\beta\)，假定在一定条件下反潜攻击方可获知该航向(见图1)。  

**图1关键信息描述**：  
1. 水平面坐标系中，潜艇航向方位角 \(\beta\) 以正北为基准顺时针标定  
2. \(X/Y\) 轴方向的正态分布误差范围示意  
3. 潜艇主体简化为长方体并标注航向关系  

由于存在定位误差，潜艇中心实际位置的3个坐标是相互独立的随机变量，其中 \(X\)，\(Y\) 均服从正态分布 \(N(0, \sigma^2)\)，\(Z\) 服从单边截尾正态分布 \(N(h_0, \sigma_z^2, l)\)，其密度函数为  
\[
f_{h_0, \sigma_z, l}(v)=\frac{1}{\sigma_z} \cdot \frac{\phi\left(\frac{v-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)}{1-\Phi\left(\frac{l-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)} \quad (l<v<+\infty),
\]  
这里 \(h_0\) 是潜艇中心位置深度的定位值，\(l\) 是潜艇中心位置实际深度的最小值，\(\phi\) 和 \(\Phi\) 分别是标准正态分布的密度函数与分布函数。  

将潜艇主体部分简化为长方体，深弹在水中垂直下降。假定深弹采用双引信(触发引信+定深引信)引爆，定深引信事先设定引爆深度，深弹在海水中的最大杀伤距离称为杀伤半径。深弹满足以下情形之一，视为命中潜艇：  
1. 航空深弹落点在目标平面尺度范围内，且引爆深度位于潜艇上表面的下方，由触发引信引爆；  
2. 航空深弹落点在目标平面尺度范围内，且引爆深度位于潜艇上表面的上方，同时潜艇在深弹的杀伤范围内，由定深引信引爆；  
5. 航空深弹落点在目标平面尺度范围外，则到达引爆深度时，由定深引信引爆，且此时潜艇在深弹的杀伤范围内。  

请建立数学模型，解决以下问题： ","Depth charges (referred to as depth bombs) were critical anti-submarine weapons during World War II. With the development of modern military technology, torpedoes have become the primary weapons in contemporary anti-submarine warfare. However, in complex sea terrains such as straits and shallow waters, some countries continue to research and develop depth charge technology due to its low cost and strong anti-jamming capabilities.  

Before attacking underwater targets, anti-submarine aircraft are typically guided by reconnaissance aircraft that detect the approximate location of submarines using electronic surveillance equipment. When submarines detect electronic tracking by reconnaissance aircraft, they usually immediately shut down electronic devices and engines, adopting silent mode for concealment.  

This problem adopts the target coordinate system:  
- The projection of the submarine's center position onto the sea surface is the origin \(O\)  
- East direction is the positive \(X\)-axis  
- South direction is the positive \(Y\)-axis  
- Downward direction perpendicular to the sea surface is the positive \(Z\)-axis  
- The heading angle \(\beta\) is defined as the clockwise rotation from true north to the submarine's direction (see Figure 1).  

**Key Information in Figure 1**:  
1. In the horizontal coordinate system, the submarine's heading angle \(\beta\) is measured clockwise from true north.  
2. Normal distribution error ranges along the \(X/Y\)-axes.  
3. Submarine body is simplified as a rectangular prism with annotated heading relationships.  

Due to positioning errors, the submarine's actual center coordinates are independent random variables:  
- \(X\) and \(Y\) follow normal distribution \(N(0, \sigma^2)\)  
- \(Z\) follows a one-sided truncated normal distribution \(N(h_0, \sigma_z^2, l)\) with density function:  
\[
f_{h_0, \sigma_z, l}(v)=\frac{1}{\sigma_z} \cdot \frac{\phi\left(\frac{v-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)}{1-\Phi\left(\frac{l-h_0}{\sigma_z}\right)} \quad (l<v<+\infty),
\]  
where \(h_0\) is the depth positioning value, \(l\) is the minimum actual depth, \(\phi\) and \(\Phi\) are the standard normal PDF and CDF, respectively.  

The submarine body is simplified as a rectangular prism. Depth charges descend vertically underwater using dual fuzes (contact fuze + depth fuze). The depth fuze is preset to detonate at a specific depth, and the maximum lethal distance underwater is defined as the kill radius. A hit is confirmed if any of the following conditions are met:  
1. The depth charge lands within the submarine's horizontal dimensions, and detonation depth is below the submarine's upper surface (contact fuze activation).  
2. The depth charge lands within the submarine's horizontal dimensions, detonation depth is above the submarine's upper surface, and the submarine is within the kill radius (depth fuze activation).  
5. The depth charge lands outside the submarine's horizontal dimensions, but the submarine is within the kill radius at the preset detonation depth (depth fuze activation).  ","## Background Context  
Depth charges remain tactically relevant anti-submarine weapons in complex terrains like straits/shallow waters due to cost-effectiveness and electronic countermeasure resistance. Modern torpedoes dominate naval warfare, yet research continues on depth charge deployment optimization.  

**Operational Framework**:  
1. **Detection Phase**: Recon aircraft locate subs via electronic surveillance  
2. **Engagement Protocol**: Anti-sub aircraft deploy charges upon target confirmation  
3. **Evasion Tactics**: Subs initiate electronic silence when detected  

**Coordinate System Specifications**:  
- Origin (o): Submarine's surface projection  
- X-axis: Eastward direction  
- Y-axis: Southward direction  
- Z-axis: Downward perpendicular  
- β: Submarine heading angle (clockwise from true North, see Fig.1)

湖羊养殖的生产过程主要包括繁殖和育肥两大环节。人工授精技术要求高，因此湖羊繁殖大多采用种公羊和基础母羊自然交配的方式。怀孕母羊分娩后给羔羊哺乳，羔羊断奶后独立喂饲，育肥长成后出栏。自然交配时将若干基础母羊与一只种公羊关在一个羊栏中，自然交配期约为3周，然后将种公羊移出。受孕母羊的孕期约为5个月，每胎通常产羔2只。母羊分娩后哺乳期通常控制在6周左右，断奶后将羔羊移至育肥羊栏喂饲。一般情况下，羔羊断奶后经过7个月左右育肥就可以出栏。母羊停止哺乳后，经过约3周的空怀休整期，一般会很快发情，可以再次配种。按上述周期，正常情况下，每只基础母羊每2年可生产3胎。在不考虑种公羊配种能力差异的情况下，种公羊与基础母羊一般按不低于1:50的比例配置。种公羊和母羊在非交配期原则上不关在同一栏中。

某湖羊养殖场设置标准羊栏，规格是：
- 空怀休整期每栏基础母羊不超过14只
- 非交配期的种公羊每栏不超过4只
- 自然交配期每栏1只种公羊及不超过14只基础母羊
- 怀孕期每栏不超过8只待产母羊
- 分娩后的哺乳期，每栏不超过6只母羊及它们的羔羊
- 育肥期每栏不超过14只羔羊

原则上不同阶段的羊只不能同栏。

养殖场的经营管理者为保障效益，需要通过制定生产计划来优化养殖场的空间利用率。这里的生产计划，主要是决定什么时间开始对多少可配种的基础母羊进行配种，控制羊只的繁育期，进而调节对羊栏的需求量，以确保有足够多的羊栏，同时尽量减少羊栏闲置。当羊栏不够时，可以租用其他场地。

Large-scale confined breeding farms typically group livestock by gender and growth stages to accommodate different spatial requirements for safety and health, while minimizing resource waste from idle space. In practice, factors like market fluctuations in feed/prices, climate, diseases, and breeding stock replacement must also be considered. However, space utilization remains a critical independent factor affecting farm profitability.  

Hu sheep, a nationally protected sheep breed in China, exhibit advantages including rapid early growth, early sexual maturity, year-round estrus, and adaptability to confinement. Hu sheep farms typically use standardized pens with capacity determined by gender, size, and growth stage.  

The production cycle comprises breeding and fattening phases. Due to technical challenges in artificial insemination, natural mating between rams and ewes is predominant. After parturition, ewes nurse lambs until weaning, after which lambs are transferred to fattening pens. Key parameters:  
- Natural mating: 3 weeks per cycle (ram removed afterward)  
- Gestation: ~5 months (2 lambs per litter)  
- Lactation: ~6 weeks  
- Fattening: ~7 months post-weaning

### 问题2
在问题1的基础上，对112个标准羊栏给出具体的生产计划（包括种公羊与基础母羊的配种时机和数量、羊栏的使用方案、年化出栏羊只数量等），使得年化出栏羊只数量最大。)

现根据经验作以下考虑：
1. 母羊通过自然交配受孕率为85%，交配期结束后30天可识别出是否成功受孕；
2. 在自然交配的20天中受孕母羊的受孕时间并不确知，而孕期会在147-150天内波动，这些因素将影响到预产期范围；
3. 怀孕母羊分娩时一般每胎产羔2只，少部分每胎产羔1只或3只及以上，目前尚没有实用手段控制或提前得知产羔数。羔羊出生时，有夭折的可能，多羔死亡率高于正常。通常可以按平均每胎产羔2.2只、羔羊平均死亡率3%估算；
4. 母羊哺乳期过短不利于羔羊后期的生长，通常是羔羊体重达到一定标准后断奶；而哺乳期过长，母羊的身体消耗就越大，早点断奶，有利于早恢复、早发情配种。一种经验做法是将哺乳期控制在35-45天内，以40天为基准，哺乳期每减少1天，羔羊的育肥期增加2天；哺乳期每增加1天，羔羊的育肥期减少2天。除此之外，母羊的空怀休整期可在不少于18天的前提下灵活调控。

此外，如有必要，允许分娩日期相差不超过7天的哺乳期母羊及所产羔羊同栏，允许断奶日期相差不超过7天的育肥期羔羊同栏，允许断奶日期相差不超过7天的休整期母羊同栏。为简化问题，不考虑母羊流产、死亡以及羔羊在哺乳期或育肥期夭折和个体发育快慢等情况。

在以上不确定性的考虑下，生产计划的制定与问题1和问题2将有较大的不同：一旦作出了“什么时间开始对多少可配种的基础母羊进行配种”的决定，后续羊栏的需求和安排不再是随之确定的，而是每一步都会出现若干种可能的情况需要作相应的并遵从基本规则的安排处理，但无法改变或调整上一步。因此，某种意义上，本问题要讨论研究的生产计划将是一个应对多种可能情况的“预案集”。

请综合考虑可行性和年化出栏羊只数量，制定具体的生产计划，使得整体方案的期望损失最小。其中整体方案的损失由羊栏使用情况决定，当羊栏空置时，每栏每天的损失为1；当羊栏数量不够时，所缺的羊栏每栏每天的损失（即租用费）为3。","### Problem 3

编队由10架无人机组成，形成圆形编队，其中9架无人机（编号FY01~FY09）均匀分布在某一圆周上，另1架无人机（编号FY00）位于圆心（见图2）。无人机基于自身感知的高度信息，均保持在同一个高度上飞行。

To maintain formation geometry, a pure bearing-only passive localization method is proposed: several UAVs in the formation transmit signals while others passively receive signals and extract directional information for positioning adjustments. Each UAV has a fixed number and maintains constant relative positions within the formation. The directional information received is defined as: the angles between the line connecting the receiving UAV and any two transmitting UAVs (see Figure 1). For example: UAVs FY01, FY02, and FY03 transmit signals, and UAV FY04 receives directional information \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \), and \( \alpha_3 \).  

**Key Figure 1 Description**:  
- Schematic showing directional angle relationships between three transmitting UAVs (FY01, FY02, FY03) and receiving UAV (FY04).  
- Annotated angles (\( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3 \)) between the receiving UAV and pairwise transmitting UAV connections.  

---  

The formation consists of 10 UAVs arranged in a circular pattern: 9 UAVs (numbered FY01~FY09) are evenly distributed on a circle, and 1 UAV (FY00) is at the center (see Figure 2). All UAVs maintain the same altitude.  

**Key Figure 2 Description**:  
- Circular formation schematic: Central UAV FY00 at the center, 9 UAVs (FY01~FY09) evenly distributed on a 100m-radius circle. ","To minimize external interference during coordinated flight maneuvers, UAV formations must operate under electromagnetic silence with limited signal emission. This problem explores positional adjustment strategies using angular data derived from passive signal reception among designated transmitter-receiver UAV pairs. All units maintain fixed identifiers and relative spatial configurations. Directional intelligence is defined as angular measurements between a receiver and pairs of transmitters (visualized in Diagram 1). For instance: Transmitters FY01, FY02, FY03 provide receiver FY04 with angular values \( \alpha_1 \), \( \alpha_2 \), \( \alpha_3 \).

**Diagram 1 Notes**:  
- Schematic shows angular relationships between three transmitters (FY01-FY03) and one receiver (FY04).  
- Arrows indicate measured angles between receiver-transmitter pairs.

---

A circular formation contains 10 UAVs: 9 units (FY01-FY09) equally spaced on a circumference, plus central unit FY00 (Diagram 2). All operate at identical altitudes.  

**Diagram 2 Notes**:  
- Circular layout: FY00 at center; 9 peripheral UAVs on 100m-radius circle.  

**Solution Requirements**:  
1. Preserve all numerical constraints (e.g., 100m radius, 50m spacing).  
2. Use angular measurements as sole input for positional corrections.  
3. Explicitly define phase sequencing for multi-step adjustment protocols.","**问题2** 实际飞行中，无人机集群也可以是其他编队队形，例如锥形编队队形（见图3，直线上相邻两架无人机的间距相等，如50m）。仍考虑纯方位无源定位的情形，设计无人机位置调整方案。

To better obtain accurate and complete ground meteorological observation information, meteorological teams are typically dispatched to key target areas in the mission zone to collect real-time meteorological data via satellite communication, ensuring the successful completion of rescue tasks.  

Multiple meteorological teams are required to establish ground meteorological observation support in multiple regions. A meteorological team sets up **1 main station** and **2 auxiliary stations** at three different locations in a region (main station IDs: 1, 2, 3, ⋯; auxiliary station IDs: 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, ⋯). Each main station deploys a vehicle-mounted satellite communication device, while each auxiliary station deploys a portable satellite communication device. The performance specifications are as follows:  

1. All observation stations communicate exclusively via point-to-point satellite links, with no distance limitations.  
2. Due to electromagnetic interference, portable devices have an 80% success rate for both sending and receiving messages. Vehicle-mounted devices are unaffected, with 100% success rates.

4. Each device can send one message at a time, with a minimum 1-minute interval between consecutive sends. Transmitting and receiving channels are independent: a device can receive multiple messages simultaneously while sending. Transmission/reception time is negligible.  
5. Auxiliary stations cannot confirm whether their sent messages are successfully received.  

For \( N \) dispatched teams, each team must collect meteorological information hourly and share it across all observation stations via satellite communication. **Meteorological message sharing** means any station's collected information must be successfully forwarded to all other stations.

"在某些紧急救援任务中，需要进行物资空投｡在地面通信系统瘫痪的情形下，为了更好地获得准确完整的地面气象观测信息，通常对任务区域的重要目标点采用派遣气象分队的方式来获取实时气象数据，通过卫星通信传输数据，从而保障救援任务的顺利完成｡  

现需派遣多支气象分队前往多个区域进行地面气象观测保障任务｡一支气象分队在一个区域的三个不同地点设立1个观测主站，2个观测副站（主站编号1,2,3,⋯;副站编号1a,1b,2a,2b,3a,3b,⋯）｡主站部署车载型卫星通信设备1套，副站各部署便携型卫星通信设备1套｡两类卫星通信设备相关性能指标如下：  

1. 所有观测站之间只能依靠卫星通信设备进行点到点通信，且通信不受空间距离的限制｡  
2. 由于受到周边电磁环境的干扰，便携型卫星通信设备发送和接收消息的成功率均为80%，但车载型卫星通信设备发送和接收消息的成功率不受影响，均为100%｡  
3. 收发消息的主要内容为气象报文信息（简称气象报文），一条气象报文内容（含所属站点编号）包含100个字符，每条消息最多可包含158个字符｡同一条气象报文可分割成上下两个半段分别传输｡  
4. 每部卫星通信设备每次只能发送一条消息，发送两条消息的时间间隔不能小于1分钟；收发通道相互独立，在发送消息时，可同时接收任意多条消息；发送和接收消息的时间非常短，可忽略｡  
5. 副站不知道本站所发送消息是否被成功接收｡  

现拟派遣N支分队执行任务，要求每小时各分队所属主副站对所在地点的气象信息进行一次采集，并按下列要求通过卫星通信设备进行气象报文的信息共享，这里，气象报文的信息共享是指任意一个观测站采集的气象信息应被成功转发到其他所有观测站｡

|  ","In certain emergency rescue missions requiring aerial delivery of supplies, ground communication systems may be paralyzed. To better obtain accurate and complete ground meteorological observation information, meteorological teams are typically dispatched to key target areas in the mission zone to collect real-time meteorological data via satellite communication, ensuring the successful completion of rescue tasks.  

Multiple meteorological teams are required to establish ground meteorological observation support in multiple regions. A meteorological team sets up **1 main station** and **2 auxiliary stations** at three different locations in a region (main station IDs: 1, 2, 3, ⋯; auxiliary station IDs: 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, ⋯). Each main station deploys a vehicle-mounted satellite communication device, while each auxiliary station deploys a portable satellite communication device. The performance specifications are as follows:  

1. All observation stations communicate exclusively via point-to-point satellite links, with no distance limitations.  
2. Due to electromagnetic interference, portable devices have an 80% success rate for both sending and receiving messages. Vehicle-mounted devices are unaffected, with 100% success rates.  
3. Meteorological messages (including station ID) contain 100 characters. Each message can carry up to 158 characters. A single meteorological message may be split into two halves for transmission.  
4. Each device can send one message at a time, with a minimum 1-minute interval between consecutive sends. Transmitting and receiving channels are independent: a device can receive multiple messages simultaneously while sending. Transmission/reception time is negligible.  
5. Auxiliary stations cannot confirm whether their sent messages are successfully received.  

For \( N \) dispatched teams, each team must collect meteorological information hourly and share it across all observation stations via satellite communication. **Meteorological message sharing** means any station's collected information must be successfully forwarded to all other stations.

Team members pull the ropes to keep the drum horizontal. At the start, a ball is dropped vertically from 40 cm above the drum’s center. Members coordinate to bounce the ball rhythmically. During the process, participants may only hold the ends of the ropes and must not touch the drum or other parts of the ropes.

The team must have **at least 8 members**, with a minimum distance of **60 cm** between adjacent members. The ball must be bounced to a height of **40 cm or more** above the drum; if it falls below this threshold, the activity stops. The goal is to maximize the number of consecutive bounces.

","esign of Mooring System**

The transmission node in a nearshore observation network consists of a buoy system, a mooring system, and a hydroacoustic communication system (as shown in Figure 1). The buoy system of a certain transmission node can be simplified as a cylinder with a base diameter of 2m and a height of 2m, with a mass of 1000kg. The mooring system comprises steel pipes, a steel barrel, a counterweight ball, a welded anchor chain, and a specialized anti-drag anchor. The anchor has a mass of 600kg, and the anchor chain uses standard open-link chains. Common types and parameters for nearshore observation networks are listed in the appendix. There are 4 steel pipes, each 1m in length, 50mm in diameter, and with a mass of 10kg per pipe. The angle between the tangent direction of the anchor chain at the connection point with the anchor and the seabed must not exceed 16 degrees; otherwise, the anchor may drag, causing node displacement and loss. The hydroacoustic communication system is installed in a sealed cylindrical steel barrel 1m in length and 30cm in outer diameter, with a total mass of 100kg (including the equipment). The steel barrel is connected to the 4th steel pipe above and the welded anchor chain below. The hydroacoustic communication device operates optimally when the steel barrel is vertical. If the barrel tilts, the device's performance is affected. When the tilt angle (angle between the barrel and the vertical line) exceeds 5 degrees, the device's performance degrades significantly. To control the tilt angle, a counterweight ball can be suspended at the connection between the steel barrel and the anchor chain.**Figure 1** Schematic diagram of the transmission node (structural module diagram, not to scale).

The design of the mooring system involves determining the type, length of the anchor chain, and the mass of the counterweight ball to minimize the buoy’s submersion depth, movement range, and the steel barrel’s tilt angle.
**Notes**  
- Offshore wind load can be approximated by \( F = 0.625 \times S v^2 \, \text{(N)} \), where \( S \) is the projected area normal to the wind (m²) and \( v \) is the wind speed (m/s).  
- Offshore current force can be approximated by \( F = 374 \times S v^2 \, \text{(N)} \), where \( S \) is the projected area normal to the current (m²) and \( v \) is the current speed (m/s).

The transmission node in a nearshore observation network consists of a buoy system, a mooring system, and a hydroacoustic communication system (as shown in Figure 1). The buoy system of a certain transmission node can be simplified as a cylinder with a base diameter of 2m and a height of 2m, with a mass of 1000kg. The mooring system comprises steel pipes, a steel barrel, a counterweight ball, a welded anchor chain, and a specialized anti-drag anchor. The anchor has a mass of 600kg, and the anchor chain uses standard open-link chains. Common types and parameters for nearshore observation networks are listed in the appendix. There are 4 steel pipes, each 1m in length, 50mm in diameter, and with a mass of 10kg per pipe. The angle between the tangent direction of the anchor chain at the connection point with the anchor and the seabed must not exceed 16 degrees; otherwise, the anchor may drag, causing node displacement and loss. The hydroacoustic communication system is installed in a sealed cylindrical steel barrel 1m in length and 30cm in outer diameter, with a total mass of 100kg (including the equipment). The steel barrel is connected to the 4th steel pipe above and the welded anchor chain below. The hydroacoustic communication device operates optimally when the steel barrel is vertical. If the barrel tilts, the device's performance is affected. When the tilt angle (angle between the barrel and the vertical line) exceeds 5 degrees, the device's performance degrades significantly. To control the tilt angle, a counterweight ball can be suspended at the connection between the steel barrel and the anchor chain.**Figure 1** Schematic diagram of the transmission node (structural module diagram, not to scale).

The design of the mooring system involves determining the type, length of the anchor chain, and the mass of the counterweight ball to minimize the buoy’s submersion depth, movement range, and the steel barrel’s tilt angle.

- Offshore wind load can be approximated by \( F = 0.625 \times S v^2 \, \text{(N)} \), where \( S \) is the projected area normal to the wind (m²) and \( v \) is the wind speed (m/s).

A near-shore observation network’s transmission node comprises a buoy, mooring components, and an acoustic communication module (Fig. 1). The buoy is modeled as a cylinder with a 2m-diameter base, 2m height, and 1000kg mass. The mooring system includes steel pipes, a steel barrel, a counterweight sphere, welded anchor chains, and a specialized anti-drag anchor (600kg mass). Anchor chain specifications are listed in the table. Four steel pipes (each 1m long, 50mm diameter, 10kg mass) connect the buoy. Critical constraints: (1) The angle between the anchor chain’s end and the seabed must not exceed 16° to prevent anchor displacement; (2) A sealed steel barrel (1m length, 30cm outer diameter, 100kg total mass with equipment) must remain within 5° tilt from vertical for optimal acoustic performance. Adjustments via counterweight sphere mass are permitted.  

**Objective**: Select anchor chain type, length, and counterweight mass to minimize buoy submersion depth, drift range, and barrel tilt.  **Formulas**:  
- Wind force: \( F_{\text{wind}} = 0.625 \times S \times v^2 \) (N), where \( S \)= projected area (m²), \( v \)= wind speed (m/s).  
- Current force: \( F_{\text{current}} = 374 \times S \times v^2 \) (N), where \( S \)= projected area (m²), \( v \)= current speed (m/s).

Urban planning and traffic management authorities have tasked your team with developing mathematical models to study the impact of opening residential quarters on surrounding road traffic, providing quantitative evidence to support policy decisions.","Assessing the Impact of Open Residential Communities on Road Traffic Efficiency**  

In February 2016, the State Council issued *Guidelines on Strengthening Urban Planning and Development Management*, emphasizing the adoption of open-block neighborhoods (Article 16). Existing gated communities and institutional compounds are to gradually transition to open access, sparking debates on whether this policy optimizes road networks, enhances traffic capacity, and alleviates congestion.  

Proponents argue that enclosed communities fragment urban road systems, clogging ""capillary"" pathways and worsening traffic. Opening these areas could increase road density and area, boosting throughput. Critics counter that outcomes depend on variables like community size, location, internal/external road layouts, and traffic flow. Others warn that added access points might overload main roads near communities, reducing speeds.  

Urban planners and transportation authorities seek quantitative models to evaluate how community openness affects adjacent road traffic.Key considerations include:  
- Interplay between community structure (e.g., internal roads, entry/exit points) and external road networks.  
- Trade-offs between increased road availability and potential bottlenecks at intersections.  
- Contextual factors like traffic volume, peak hours, and spatial distribution.  

Deliverables must provide rigorous, data-driven insights to inform evidence-based policymaking.

"连铸是将钢水变成钢坯的生产过程，具体流程如下(图1)：钢水连续地从中间包浇入结晶器，并按一定的速度从结晶器向下拉出，进入二冷段。钢水经过结晶器时，与结晶器表面接触的地方形成固态的坯壳。在二冷段，坯壳逐渐增厚并最终凝固形成钢坯。然后，按照一定的尺寸要求对钢坯进行切割。

**图1关键信息描述**：  
- 中间包位于顶部  
- 拉坯方向为垂直向下  
- 切割机工作起点位于结晶器下方  
- 二冷段包含切割枪装置  
- 连铸机包含结晶器和切割行程  

在连铸停浇时，会产生尾坯，尾坯的长度与中间包中剩余的钢水量及其他因素有关。因此，尾坯的切割也是连铸切割的组成部分。

切割机在切割钢坯时，有一个固定的工作起点，钢坯的切割必须从工作起点开始。在切割过程中，切割机骑在钢坯上与钢坯同步移动，保证切割线与拉坯的方向垂直。在切割结束后，再返回到工作起点，等待下一次切割。

在切割方案中，优先考虑切割损失，要求切割损失尽量小，这里将切割损失定义为报废钢坯的长度；其次考虑用户要求，在相同的切割损失下，切割出的钢坯尽量满足用户的目标值。

在浇钢过程中，结晶器会出现异常。这时，位于结晶器内部的一段钢坯需要报废，称此段钢坯为报废段(图2)。当结晶器出现异常时，切割工序会马上知道，以便立即调整切割方案。

**图2关键信息描述**：  
- 报废段1和报废段2位于结晶器内部  
- 切割枪位于工作起点附近  
- 结晶器中心到切割机工作起点的钢坯长度为60.0米  

切割后的钢坯在进入下道工序时不能含有报废段。当钢坯出现报废段时，先通过切割机切断附着有报废段的钢坯，然后通过离线的二次切割，使余下的钢坯符合下道工序要求的长度；其他进入下道工序的钢坯也必须满足下道工序的长度要求。

## 附录：参数与要求  
**工艺参数**：
\begin{itemize}
\item 切割机切断一块钢坯的时间为3分钟
\item 切割后返回到工作起点的时间为1分钟
\item 从结晶器中心到切割机工作起点处钢坯的长度是60.0米
\item 连铸拉坯的速度为1.0米/分钟
\item 当结晶器出现异常时，报废段的长度是0.8米  
\end{itemize}

**基本要求**：
\begin{itemize}
\item 切割后的钢坯长度必须在4.8~12.6米之间，否则无法运走，阻碍生产
\item 下道工序能够接受的钢坯长度是8.0~11.6米，如果不在此范围内，可以将钢坯运走进行二次离线切割，但切割下的部分报废，从而产生损失  
\end{itemize}

**正常要求**：
\begin{itemize}
\item 正常切割按照用户要求的长度进行切割
\item 用户要求包含目标值和目标范围，切割长度应尽量满足目标值，目标范围内可接受
\item 钢坯长度超出目标范围时产生损失  
\end{itemize}

现请你们团队建立数学模型或设计算法，解决以下问题：","## Problem D Online Optimization of Continuous Casting and Cutting  
Continuous casting is the production process of transforming molten steel into steel billets. The specific process is as follows (Figure 1): Molten steel is continuously poured from the tundish into the mold and pulled downward from the mold at a certain speed into the secondary cooling zone. When passing through the mold, the molten steel forms a solid shell at the contact surface with the mold. In the secondary cooling zone, the shell gradually thickens and finally solidifies into a steel billet. The steel billet is then cut according to specific size requirements.  

**Key Information Description of Figure 1**:  
- Tundish is located at the top  
- Billet withdrawal direction is vertically downward  
- Cutting machine starting point is below the mold  
- Secondary cooling zone contains cutting torch devices  
- Continuous casting machine includes the mold and cutting stroke  

When continuous casting stops, a tail billet is produced. The length of the tail billet is related to the remaining molten steel volume in the tundish and other factors. Therefore, tail billet cutting is also part of continuous casting cutting.  

The cutting machine has a fixed starting point for cutting billets. Cutting must begin from this starting point. During cutting, the cutting machine moves synchronously with the billet to ensure the cutting line is perpendicular to the billet withdrawal direction. After cutting, it returns to the starting point to await the next cut.  

In the cutting plan, priority is given to minimizing cutting loss (defined as the length of scrapped billets). Secondary priority is given to user requirements: under equal cutting losses, the cut billets should meet the user's target values as much as possible.  

During casting, abnormalities may occur in the mold. At this time, a segment of the billet inside the mold needs to be scrapped, referred to as the scrapped segment (Figure 2). When mold abnormalities occur, the cutting process is immediately notified to adjust the cutting plan.  

**Key Information Description of Figure 2**:  
- Scrapped Segment 1 and Scrapped Segment 2 are located inside the mold  
- Cutting torch is near the starting point  
- The length from the mold center to the cutting machine starting point is 60.0 meters  

Cut billets entering subsequent processes must not contain scrapped segments. When a billet contains scrapped segments:  
1. First use the cutting machine to cut off the billet segment attached with the scrapped segment  
2. Perform offline secondary cutting on the remaining billet to meet subsequent process length requirements  
3. All other billets entering subsequent processes must also meet length requirements  

## Appendix: Parameters and Requirements  
**Process Parameters**:  
\begin{itemize}  
\item Cutting machine time per billet: 3 minutes  
\item Return time to starting point after cutting: 1 minute  
\item Billet length from mold center to cutting machine starting point: 60.0 meters  
\item Continuous casting withdrawal speed: 1.0 meters/minute  
\item Scrapped segment length during mold abnormalities: 0.8 meters  
\end{itemize}  

**Basic Requirements**:  
\begin{itemize}  
\item Cut billet length must be between 4.8-12.6 meters; otherwise, transportation is impossible and production is obstructed  
\item Subsequent processes accept billet lengths of 8.0-11.6 meters. Billets outside this range require secondary offline cutting, with cut portions scrapped (resulting in loss)  
\end{itemize}  

**Normal Requirements**:  
\begin{itemize}  
\item Normal cutting should follow user-specified target lengths  
\item User requirements include target values and acceptable ranges  
\item Cutting lengths should prioritize meeting target values within acceptable ranges  
\item Billet lengths exceeding target ranges result in losses  
\end{itemize}  

Please establish mathematical models or design algorithms to solve the following problems:  ","### **Process Overview**  
Continuous casting converts molten steel into semi-finished billets through the following stages (**Figure 1**):  
- Molten steel flows from a tundish into a water-cooled mold.  
- The mold withdraws downward at a fixed rate into secondary cooling zones.  
- A solid shell forms at the mold-steel interface, thickening until full solidification.  
- Billets are cut to specified lengths using an automated cutter.  

**Key Challenges**:  
- **Tail Billets**: Residual steel in the tundish creates variable-length tail billets during casting termination.  
- **Defective Segments**: Mold malfunctions produce scrapped billet sections (**Figure 2**), requiring immediate cutting adjustments.  

**Cutter Operation**:  
- Fixed starting position; synchronized movement with the billet during cutting.  
- Post-cut return to origin for next operation.  

**Optimization Goals**:  
1. Minimize material loss (scrapped length).  
2. Prioritize user-specified target lengths within allowable ranges.  

### **Technical Specifications**  

**Process Parameters**:  
- Cutting duration per billet: **3 min**  
- Cutter reset time: **1 min**  
- Mold-to-cutter distance: **60.0 m**  
- Casting speed: **1.0 m/min**  

**Constraints**:  
1. **Basic**: Cut billets must be **4.8–12.6 m**; otherwise, production halts.  
2. **Downstream Requirements**:  
   - Acceptable range: **8.0–11.6 m**  
   - Offline cutting required for out-of-range billets (excess length scrapped).  

**User Priorities**:  
- Preferred length: Target value (e.g., 9.5 m).  
- Tolerance: ±0.5 m from target.  
- Loss = |Actual length - Target| if outside tolerance.

在模型的验证过程中，应给出具体的切割方案。例如，长度为62.7米的尾坏，其切割损失是2.7米。如果在切割方案中，出现12.7米长度的钢坯经二次离线切割再切掉2.7米，则该方案是错误的，因为12.7米超出了题目设定的范围（4.8米～12.6米）。对于没有具体切割方案的结果，可视为切割方案不正确。

此问题的重点仍然是建模（或设计算法），模型（或算法）可依据问题1中给出的模型（或算法）经改进得到。  

在问题2和问题3的数值结果中，  
1. 需要明确给出具体的切割方案，特别是二次离线切割中需要切掉的部分；  
2. 应明确指出：在哪些时刻应对哪一段的切割方案进行调整，以及为什么要调整方案的理由。  

## 3. 评阅建议：  

\begin{enumerate}  
  \item 回答问题的重点是建立数学模型，如果建模有困难，设计出相关算法可视为成功建模。  
  \item 无论模型还是算法（特别是算法），应有必要的解释，说明模型（或算法）可获得最优切割方案的合理性。  
  \item 数值计算只是检验模型（或算法）是否正确的手段，仅给出数值计算结果但没有给出建模过程（或设计算法的过程），不能视为是一篇好的论文，即便其数值结果是正确的。  
  \item 在数值结果中，应包含具体的切割方案，如哪一部分钢坯需要在二次离线切割中切掉。  
  \item 题目要求在线优化，因此，在算法的设计及计算中，不能使用“未来时间”的数据。

## 1. Optimal Cutting Scheme Based on Tail Billet Length  

The core task is to establish a mathematical model (or design an algorithm) for optimal tail billet cutting. The paper should provide reasonable explanations for the model/algorithm, especially for algorithmic approaches. After defining the model, its correctness must be verified using the given data.  

**Validation Requirements**:  
- Specific cutting schemes must be provided. For example:  
  - A tail billet of length **62.7 meters** with a cutting loss of **2.7 meters**.  
  - A scheme proposing a 12.7-meter billet requiring secondary offline cutting to remove 2.7 meters is **invalid**, as 12.7 meters exceeds the allowable range (4.8–12.6 meters).  
- Results without explicit cutting schemes are deemed incorrect.  

## 2. Online Optimization for Continuous Casting Defects  

The focus remains on modeling (or algorithm design), which may extend or modify the model from Problem 1.  

**Requirements for Problems 2 and 3**:  
1. Explicitly state cutting schemes, particularly the portions to be removed via secondary offline cutting.  
2. Clearly identify:  
   - Timestamps for adjusting cutting schemes.  
   - Reasons for adjustments.  

## 3. Evaluation Guidelines  

\begin{enumerate}  
  \item The primary focus is on mathematical modeling. If modeling is challenging, designing a relevant algorithm is acceptable.  
  \item Both models and algorithms (especially algorithms) must include justifications for their optimality.  
  \item Numerical results alone are insufficient. Papers must detail the modeling/algorithm design process, even if results are correct.  
  \item Numerical outcomes must specify cutting details, e.g., which billet segments require secondary offline cutting.

"连铸是将钢水变成钢坯的生产过程，具体流程如下(图1)：钢水连续地从中间包浇入结晶器，并按一定的速度从结晶器向下拉出，进入二冷段。钢水经过结晶器时，与结晶器表面接触的地方形成固态的坯壳。在二冷段，坯壳逐渐增厚并最终凝固形成钢坯。然后，按照一定的尺寸要求对钢坯进行切割。

**图1关键信息描述**：  
- 中间包位于顶部  
- 拉坯方向为垂直向下  
- 切割机工作起点位于结晶器下方  
- 二冷段包含切割枪装置  
- 连铸机包含结晶器和切割行程  

在连铸停浇时，会产生尾坯，尾坯的长度与中间包中剩余的钢水量及其他因素有关。因此，尾坯的切割也是连铸切割的组成部分。

切割机在切割钢坯时，有一个固定的工作起点，钢坯的切割必须从工作起点开始。在切割过程中，切割机骑在钢坯上与钢坯同步移动，保证切割线与拉坯的方向垂直。在切割结束后，再返回到工作起点，等待下一次切割。

在切割方案中，优先考虑切割损失，要求切割损失尽量小，这里将切割损失定义为报废钢坯的长度；其次考虑用户要求，在相同的切割损失下，切割出的钢坯尽量满足用户的目标值。

在浇钢过程中，结晶器会出现异常。这时，位于结晶器内部的一段钢坯需要报废，称此段钢坯为报废段(图2)。当结晶器出现异常时，切割工序会马上知道，以便立即调整切割方案。

**图2关键信息描述**：  
- 报废段1和报废段2位于结晶器内部  
- 切割枪位于工作起点附近  
- 结晶器中心到切割机工作起点的钢坯长度为60.0米  

切割后的钢坯在进入下道工序时不能含有报废段。当钢坯出现报废段时，先通过切割机切断附着有报废段的钢坯，然后通过离线的二次切割，使余下的钢坯符合下道工序要求的长度；其他进入下道工序的钢坯也必须满足下道工序的长度要求。

现请你们团队建立数学模型或设计算法，解决以下问题：","## Problem D Online Optimization of Continuous Casting and Cutting  
Continuous casting is the production process of transforming molten steel into steel billets. The specific process is as follows (Figure 1): Molten steel is continuously poured from the tundish into the mold and pulled downward from the mold at a certain speed into the secondary cooling zone. When passing through the mold, the molten steel forms a solid shell at the contact surface with the mold. In the secondary cooling zone, the shell gradually thickens and finally solidifies into a steel billet. The steel billet is then cut according to specific size requirements.  

**Key Information Description of Figure 1**:  
- Tundish is located at the top  
- Billet withdrawal direction is vertically downward  
- Cutting machine starting point is below the mold  
- Secondary cooling zone contains cutting torch devices  
- Continuous casting machine includes the mold and cutting stroke  

When continuous casting stops, a tail billet is produced. The length of the tail billet is related to the remaining molten steel volume in the tundish and other factors. Therefore, tail billet cutting is also part of continuous casting cutting.  

The cutting machine has a fixed starting point for cutting billets. Cutting must begin from this starting point. During cutting, the cutting machine moves synchronously with the billet to ensure the cutting line is perpendicular to the billet withdrawal direction. After cutting, it returns to the starting point to await the next cut.  

In the cutting plan, priority is given to minimizing cutting loss (defined as the length of scrapped billets). Secondary priority is given to user requirements: under equal cutting losses, the cut billets should meet the user's target values as much as possible.  

During casting, abnormalities may occur in the mold. At this time, a segment of the billet inside the mold needs to be scrapped, referred to as the scrapped segment (Figure 2). When mold abnormalities occur, the cutting process is immediately notified to adjust the cutting plan.  

**Key Information Description of Figure 2**:  
- Scrapped Segment 1 and Scrapped Segment 2 are located inside the mold  
- Cutting torch is near the starting point  
- The length from the mold center to the cutting machine starting point is 60.0 meters  

Cut billets entering subsequent processes must not contain scrapped segments. When a billet contains scrapped segments:  
1. First use the cutting machine to cut off the billet segment attached with the scrapped segment  
2. Perform offline secondary cutting on the remaining billet to meet subsequent process length requirements  
3. All other billets entering subsequent processes must also meet length requirements  

## Appendix: Parameters and Requirements  
**Process Parameters**:  
\begin{itemize}  
\item Cutting machine time per billet: 3 minutes  
\item Return time to starting point after cutting: 1 minute  
\item Billet length from mold center to cutting machine starting point: 60.0 meters  
\item Continuous casting withdrawal speed: 1.0 meters/minute  
\item Scrapped segment length during mold abnormalities: 0.8 meters  
\end{itemize}  

**Basic Requirements**:  
\begin{itemize}  
\item Cut billet length must be between 4.8-12.6 meters; otherwise, transportation is impossible and production is obstructed  
\item Subsequent processes accept billet lengths of 8.0-11.6 meters. Billets outside this range require secondary offline cutting, with cut portions scrapped (resulting in loss)  
\end{itemize}  

**Normal Requirements**:  
\begin{itemize}  
\item Normal cutting should follow user-specified target lengths  
\item User requirements include target values and acceptable ranges  
\item Cutting lengths should prioritize meeting target values within acceptable ranges  
\item Billet lengths exceeding target ranges result in losses  
\end{itemize}  

Please establish mathematical models or design algorithms to solve the following problems:  ","### **Process Overview**  
Continuous casting converts molten steel into semi-finished billets through the following stages (**Figure 1**):  
- Molten steel flows from a tundish into a water-cooled mold.  
- The mold withdraws downward at a fixed rate into secondary cooling zones.  
- A solid shell forms at the mold-steel interface, thickening until full solidification.  
- Billets are cut to specified lengths using an automated cutter.  

**Key Challenges**:  
- **Tail Billets**: Residual steel in the tundish creates variable-length tail billets during casting termination.  
- **Defective Segments**: Mold malfunctions produce scrapped billet sections (**Figure 2**), requiring immediate cutting adjustments.  

**Cutter Operation**:  
- Fixed starting position; synchronized movement with the billet during cutting.  
- Post-cut return to origin for next operation.  

**Optimization Goals**:  
1. Minimize material loss (scrapped length).  
2. Prioritize user-specified target lengths within allowable ranges.  

### **Technical Specifications**  

**Process Parameters**:  
- Cutting duration per billet: **3 min**  
- Cutter reset time: **1 min**  
- Mold-to-cutter distance: **60.0 m**  
- Casting speed: **1.0 m/min**  

**Constraints**:  
1. **Basic**: Cut billets must be **4.8–12.6 m**; otherwise, production halts.  
2. **Downstream Requirements**:  
   - Acceptable range: **8.0–11.6 m**  
   - Offline cutting required for out-of-range billets (excess length scrapped).  

**User Priorities**:  
- Preferred length: Target value (e.g., 9.5 m).  
- Tolerance: ±0.5 m from target.  
- Loss = |Actual length - Target| if outside tolerance.

Continuous casting is the production process of transforming molten steel into steel billets. The specific process is as follows (Figure 1): Molten steel is continuously poured from the tundish into the mold and pulled downward from the mold at a certain speed into the secondary cooling zone. When passing through the mold, the molten steel forms a solid shell at the contact surface with the mold. In the secondary cooling zone, the shell gradually thickens and finally solidifies into a steel billet. The steel billet is then cut according to specific size requirements.  

**Key Information Description of Figure 1**:  
- Tundish is located at the top  
- Billet withdrawal direction is vertically downward  
- Cutting machine starting point is below the mold  
- Secondary cooling zone contains cutting torch devices  
- Continuous casting machine includes the mold and cutting stroke  

When continuous casting stops, a tail billet is produced. The length of the tail billet is related to the remaining molten steel volume in the tundish and other factors. Therefore, tail billet cutting is also part of continuous casting cutting.  

The cutting machine has a fixed starting point for cutting billets. Cutting must begin from this starting point. During cutting, the cutting machine moves synchronously with the billet to ensure the cutting line is perpendicular to the billet withdrawal direction. After cutting, it returns to the starting point to await the next cut.  

In the cutting plan, priority is given to minimizing cutting loss (defined as the length of scrapped billets). Secondary priority is given to user requirements: under equal cutting losses, the cut billets should meet the user's target values as much as possible.  

During casting, abnormalities may occur in the mold. At this time, a segment of the billet inside the mold needs to be scrapped, referred to as the scrapped segment (Figure 2). When mold abnormalities occur, the cutting process is immediately notified to adjust the cutting plan.  

**Key Information Description of Figure 2**:  
- Scrapped Segment 1 and Scrapped Segment 2 are located inside the mold  
- Cutting torch is near the starting point  
- The length from the mold center to the cutting machine starting point is 60.0 meters  

Cut billets entering subsequent processes must not contain scrapped segments. When a billet contains scrapped segments:  
1. First use the cutting machine to cut off the billet segment attached with the scrapped segment  
2. Perform offline secondary cutting on the remaining billet to meet subsequent process length requirements  
3. All other billets entering subsequent processes must also meet length requirements

\end{itemize}  

Please establish mathematical models or design algorithms to solve the following problems:  ","### **Process Overview**  
Continuous casting converts molten steel into semi-finished billets through the following stages (**Figure 1**):  
- Molten steel flows from a tundish into a water-cooled mold.  
- The mold withdraws downward at a fixed rate into secondary cooling zones.  
- A solid shell forms at the mold-steel interface, thickening until full solidification.  
- Billets are cut to specified lengths using an automated cutter.  

**Key Challenges**:  
- **Tail Billets**: Residual steel in the tundish creates variable-length tail billets during casting termination.  
- **Defective Segments**: Mold malfunctions produce scrapped billet sections (**Figure 2**), requiring immediate cutting adjustments.  

**Cutter Operation**:  
- Fixed starting position; synchronized movement with the billet during cutting.  
- Post-cut return to origin for next operation.  

**Optimization Goals**:  
1. Minimize material loss (scrapped length).  
2. Prioritize user-specified target lengths within allowable ranges.  

### **Technical Specifications**  

**Process Parameters**:  
- Cutting duration per billet: **3 min**  
- Cutter reset time: **1 min**  
- Mold-to-cutter distance: **60.0 m**  
- Casting speed: **1.0 m/min**  

**Constraints**:  
1. **Basic**: Cut billets must be **4.8–12.6 m**; otherwise, production halts.  
2. **Downstream Requirements**:  
   - Acceptable range: **8.0–11.6 m**  
   - Offline cutting required for out-of-range billets (excess length scrapped).  

**User Priorities**:  
- Preferred length: Target value (e.g., 9.5 m).  
- Tolerance: ±0.5 m from target.  
- Loss = |Actual length - Target| if outside tolerance.

## 1. 依据尾坏的长度，制定最优的切割方案。  

该问题的重点是建立尾坏最优切割的数学模型（或设计算法），论文应对模型（或算法，特别是算法）给出合理的解释或说明。在确定模型之后，再利用题目给出的数据，验证模型（或算法）的正确性。  

在模型的验证过程中，应给出具体的切割方案。例如，长度为62.7米的尾坏，其切割损失是2.7米。如果在切割方案中，出现12.7米长度的钢坯经二次离线切割再切掉2.7米，则该方案是错误的，因为12.7米超出了题目设定的范围（4.8米～12.6米）。对于没有具体切割方案的结果，可视为切割方案不正确。  

## 2. 连续坏的在线优化切割，在出现瑕疵时，明确回答是否调整当前段的切割方案。  

此问题的重点仍然是建模（或设计算法），模型（或算法）可依据问题1中给出的模型（或算法）经改进得到。  

在问题2和问题3的数值结果中，  
1. 需要明确给出具体的切割方案，特别是二次离线切割中需要切掉的部分；  
2. 应明确指出：在哪些时刻应对哪一段的切割方案进行调整，以及为什么要调整方案的理由。

\begin{enumerate}  
  \item 回答问题的重点是建立数学模型，如果建模有困难，设计出相关算法可视为成功建模。  
  \item 无论模型还是算法（特别是算法），应有必要的解释，说明模型（或算法）可获得最优切割方案的合理性。  
  \item 数值计算只是检验模型（或算法）是否正确的手段，仅给出数值计算结果但没有给出建模过程（或设计算法的过程），不能视为是一篇好的论文，即便其数值结果是正确的。  
  \item 在数值结果中，应包含具体的切割方案，如哪一部分钢坯需要在二次离线切割中切掉。  
  \item 题目要求在线优化，因此，在算法的设计及计算中，不能使用“未来时间”的数据。  
\end{enumerate}  ","The problem primarily involves two aspects: **optimal cutting of tail billets** and **online optimization of continuous casting defects**. The provided dataset is limited and intended for model (or algorithm) validation.  

## 1. Optimal Cutting Scheme Based on Tail Billet Length  

The core task is to establish a mathematical model (or design an algorithm) for optimal tail billet cutting. The paper should provide reasonable explanations for the model/algorithm, especially for algorithmic approaches. After defining the model, its correctness must be verified using the given data.  

**Validation Requirements**:  
- Specific cutting schemes must be provided. For example:  
  - A tail billet of length **62.7 meters** with a cutting loss of **2.7 meters**.  
  - A scheme proposing a 12.7-meter billet requiring secondary offline cutting to remove 2.7 meters is **invalid**, as 12.7 meters exceeds the allowable range (4.8–12.6 meters).  
- Results without explicit cutting schemes are deemed incorrect.  

## 2. Online Optimization for Continuous Casting Defects  

The focus remains on modeling (or algorithm design), which may extend or modify the model from Problem 1.  

**Requirements for Problems 2 and 3**:  
1. Explicitly state cutting schemes, particularly the portions to be removed via secondary offline cutting.  
2. Clearly identify:  
   - Timestamps for adjusting cutting schemes.  
   - Reasons for adjustments.  

## 3. Evaluation Guidelines  

\begin{enumerate}  
  \item The primary focus is on mathematical modeling. If modeling is challenging, designing a relevant algorithm is acceptable.  
  \item Both models and algorithms (especially algorithms) must include justifications for their optimality.  
  \item Numerical results alone are insufficient. Papers must detail the modeling/algorithm design process, even if results are correct.  
  \item Numerical outcomes must specify cutting details, e.g., which billet segments require secondary offline cutting.  
  \item Online optimization prohibits the use of ""future-time"" data in algorithm design or computations.

The general process is as follows: After mating, sows gestate for approximately 114 days before giving birth to piglets, which become piglets after the lactation period. A portion of the piglets will be selected as breeding pigs (with varying male-to-female ratios depending on mating methods) to undertake future reproduction tasks; some piglets may be sold as piglets to control the farm's scale; and most piglets are castrated and raised as market pigs for slaughter (see Figure 1). Sows have a reproductive lifespan of 3–5 years, after which non-productive boars and sows are humanely disposed of. Both breeding and market pigs consume feed daily, but breeding pigs incur higher feed costs. The farm optimizes profitability by adjusting breeding stock numbers, mating schedules, and herd size based on market conditions.

"某养猪场最多能养10000头猪，该养猪场利用自己的种猪进行繁育。养猪的一般过程是：母猪配种后怀孕约114天产下乳猪，经过哺乳期后乳猪成为小猪。小猪的一部分将被选为种猪（其中公猪母猪的比例因配种方式而异），长大以后承担养猪场的繁殖任务；有时也会将一部分小猪作为猪苗出售以控制养殖规模；而大部分小猪经阉割后养成肉猪出栏（见图1）。母猪的生育期一般为3～5年，失去生育能力的公猪和母猪将被无害化处理掉。种猪和肉猪每天都要消耗饲料，但种猪的饲料成本更高一些。养殖场根据市场情况通过决定留种数量、配种时间、存栏规模等优化经营策略以提高盈利水平。请收集相关数据，建立数学模型回答以下问题：

本问题要求在已知9个月后预测价格条件下，寻求养殖场较合理的经营管理策略，这是本题的核心问题。应有明确的优化策略。  
母猪存栏数以及有龄母猪配种率直接影响大约9个月后的生猪存栏数，从而影响利润率，所以这是本问题要考虑的关键因素。在利用题目所给的生猪价格预测曲线时，预测区间取为9个月较为切合实际。并且，预测价格与实际价格之间肯定存在一定的偏差，加入在建模时能够将这种偏差纳入策略挑选考虑，则更佳。  
评阅时应考察各种成本参数取值是否在合理范围内，以及猪苗出售价格是否合理。在参数合理取值的条件下，平均年利润的合理范围大约为：400万-700万。过低则优化不足，过高应检查假定及参数取值是否过于脱离实际。  

解决本问题的方法之一是：建立分时段的母猪、小猪及肉猪数量之间的递推关系式，然后通过仿真比较不同策略下的利润率，寻求较合理的经营管理策略。","**Problem 3. Management Model and Strategy**  
This core problem requires developing a rational management strategy under a 9-month price forecast. An explicit optimization framework is essential.  
The sow inventory and age-specific breeding rates directly influence hog inventory ~9 months later, thereby affecting profitability. The price forecast horizon should align with this 9-month cycle. Incorporating price prediction uncertainties into the model (e.g., through sensitivity analysis or stochastic optimization) will enhance robustness.  
Evaluators will scrutinize cost parameter ranges (e.g., feed costs: 1,200-2,000 CNY/head for hogs, 2,000-3,000 CNY/year for sows) and piglet sale price rationality. Under reasonable parameters, the average annual profit should fall within 4-7 million CNY. Results outside this range may indicate under-optimization or unrealistic assumptions.  

A viable solution method involves:  
1. Establishing time-discrete recursive relationships among sow, piglet, and hog populations  
2. Simulating profitability under different strategies  
3. Optimizing breeding rates and culling policies using the price forecast curve  
4. Incorporating risk metrics for price deviations (e.g., CVaR or Monte Carlo scenarios)

**图1关键信息描述**：  
- **场景范围**：800×800单位平面区域，原点O(0,0)为机器人起始点。  
- **障碍物分布**： 如上文描述  

在图1的平面场景中，障碍物外指定一点为机器人要到达的目标点（要求目标点与障碍物的距离至少超过10个单位）。规定机器人的行走路径由直线段和圆弧组成，其中圆弧是机器人转弯路径。机器人不能折线转弯，转弯路径由与直线路径相切的一段圆弧组成，也可以由两个或多个相切的圆弧路径组成，但每个圆弧的半径最小为10个单位。为了不与障碍物发生碰撞，同时要求机器人行走线路与障碍物间的最近距离为10个单位，否则将发生碰撞，若碰撞发生，则机器人无法完成行走。  

机器人直线行走的最大速度为 $v_{0} = 5$ 个单位/秒。机器人转弯时，最大转弯速度为  
$$  
v = v(\rho) = \frac{v_{0}}{1 + e^{10 - 0.1\rho^{2}}}

**Key Information of Figure 1**:  
- **Scene Range**: 800×800 unit plane with the robot starting at origin O(0,0).  
- **Obstacle Distribution**: As described above.  

In this scene, a target point (with at least 10 units distance from obstacles) must be reached by the robot. The robot's path consists of straight-line segments and circular arcs (turning paths). Turns must be composed of arcs tangent to straight-line segments, or multiple tangent arcs, with each arc having a minimum radius of 10 units. The robot's path must maintain a minimum distance of 10 units from obstacles.  

The robot's maximum straight-line speed is $v_{0} = 5$ units/sec. The maximum turning speed is:  
$$  
v = v(\rho) = \frac{v_{0}}{1 + e^{10 - 0.1\rho^{2}}}  
$$  
where $\rho$ is the turning radius. Exceeding this speed causes the robot to overturn.

   - Arcs must be tangent to adjacent straight segments; multi-arc turns are allowed if arcs are mutually tangent.  
   - Minimum turning radius: **10 units**.  

2. **Collision Avoidance**:  
   - Paths must maintain a **10-unit clearance** from all obstacles. Violations result in mission failure.  

3. **Velocity Limits**:  
   - Straight-line speed: $v_0 = 5$ units/sec.

1. 预处理：将原始障碍物作适当扩大，确保不发生碰撞。在合理的假设下，要求预处理步骤清晰，说明适当，明确给出最后的处理结果。

2. 数学模型：必须明确建立路程最短和时间最少的优化模型，要给出明确的决策变量、目标函数和约束条件，表述准确全面。

3. 求解方法：机器人路径规划求解方法较多，尽量选择合适的求解方法和相应的算法，给出求解方法的思想，求解算法的步骤或流程图，并给出图形的预处理过程和描述。

4. 结果与分析：要有明确的数值结果和路线图，表达简明、清晰。最优路径应由直线段与圆弧光滑连接而成。例如，第一问的圆弧半径为10，第二问的圆弧半径需通过优化模型计算得到。例如，到B点距离最短的最优路径可参见图1，到A点时间最短的最优路径可参见图2。

5. 深入分析：本问题有较大的发挥空间，参赛者利用参考文献作深入分析时，可考虑适当加分。
（1）讨论不同算法对2种最优结果的影响；
（2）适当考虑直线行走与转弯之间时间延迟的影响；
（3）适当扩充，讨论障碍物变形或不规则障碍物对最优结果的影响等；

","# Problem Overview  
Commonly found in computer graphics processing and robotic autonomous navigation, 2D and 3D obstacle avoidance are hot research topics. Obstacle avoidance in fixed scenarios represents a simpler case, as it does not involve moving obstacles or obstacle recognition. The mathematical models and solution algorithms for this problem remain largely similar.  

1. **Preprocessing**: Appropriately expand the original obstacles to ensure no collisions occur. Under reasonable assumptions, the preprocessing steps must be clear, well-explained, and explicitly state the final processed results.  

2. **Mathematical Model**: Establish optimization models for shortest distance and minimum time. Clearly define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints. Ensure the formulation is accurate and comprehensive.  

3. **Solution Method**: Numerous methods exist for robotic path planning. Select suitable solution methods and algorithms, describe their principles, present algorithm steps or flowcharts, and detail the graphical preprocessing process.  

4. **Results and Analysis**: Provide explicit numerical results and route maps, presented concisely and clearly. The optimal path should consist of smooth connections between straight-line segments and circular arcs. For example:  
   - The arc radius for the first question is 10 units.  
   - The arc radius for the second question should be calculated via the optimization model.  
   - Example: The shortest-distance optimal path to point B is shown in Figure 1; the minimum-time optimal path to point A is shown in Figure 2.  

5. **In-depth Analysis**: This problem offers significant room for exploration. Contestants may earn bonus points by incorporating references for deeper analysis:  
   (1) Discuss the impact of different algorithms on the two types of optimal results;  
   (2) Consider the time delay effects between straight-line motion and turning;  
   (3) Expand the discussion to include deformed or irregular obstacles and their influence on optimal results;  
   (4) Qualitatively analyze the effects of moving obstacles or target points, or discuss 3D spatial scenarios.

在图1的平面场景中，障碍物外指定一点为机器人要到达的目标点（要求目标点与障碍物的距离至少超过10个单位）。规定机器人的行走路径由直线段和圆弧组成，其中圆弧是机器人转弯路径。机器人不能折线转弯，转弯路径由与直线路径相切的一段圆弧组成，也可以由两个或多个相切的圆弧路径组成，但每个圆弧的半径最小为10个单位。为了不与障碍物发生碰撞，同时要求机器人行走线路与障碍物间的最近距离为10个单位，否则将发生碰撞，若碰撞发生，则机器人无法完成行走。  

机器人直线行走的最大速度为 $v_{0} = 5$ 个单位/秒。机器人转弯时，最大转弯速度为  
$$  
v = v(\rho) = \frac{v_{0}}{1 + e^{10 - 0.1\rho^{2}}}

**Key Information of Figure 1**:  
- **Scene Range**: 800×800 unit plane with the robot starting at origin O(0,0).  
- **Obstacle Distribution**: As described above.  

In this scene, a target point (with at least 10 units distance from obstacles) must be reached by the robot. The robot's path consists of straight-line segments and circular arcs (turning paths). Turns must be composed of arcs tangent to straight-line segments, or multiple tangent arcs, with each arc having a minimum radius of 10 units. The robot's path must maintain a minimum distance of 10 units from obstacles.  

The robot's maximum straight-line speed is $v_{0} = 5$ units/sec. The maximum turning speed is:  
$$  
v = v(\rho) = \frac{v_{0}}{1 + e^{10 - 0.1\rho^{2}}}  
$$  
where $\rho$ is the turning radius. Exceeding this speed causes the robot to overturn.

","# Problem Overview  
Commonly found in computer graphics processing and robotic autonomous navigation, 2D and 3D obstacle avoidance are hot research topics. Obstacle avoidance in fixed scenarios represents a simpler case, as it does not involve moving obstacles or obstacle recognition. The mathematical models and solution algorithms for this problem remain largely similar.  

1. **Preprocessing**: Appropriately expand the original obstacles to ensure no collisions occur. Under reasonable assumptions, the preprocessing steps must be clear, well-explained, and explicitly state the final processed results.  

2. **Mathematical Model**: Establish optimization models for shortest distance and minimum time. Clearly define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints. Ensure the formulation is accurate and comprehensive.  

3. **Solution Method**: Numerous methods exist for robotic path planning. Select suitable solution methods and algorithms, describe their principles, present algorithm steps or flowcharts, and detail the graphical preprocessing process.  

4. **Results and Analysis**: Provide explicit numerical results and route maps, presented concisely and clearly. The optimal path should consist of smooth connections between straight-line segments and circular arcs. For example:  
   - The arc radius for the first question is 10 units.  
   - The arc radius for the second question should be calculated via the optimization model.  
   - Example: The shortest-distance optimal path to point B is shown in Figure 1; the minimum-time optimal path to point A is shown in Figure 2.  

5. **In-depth Analysis**: This problem offers significant room for exploration. Contestants may earn bonus points by incorporating references for deeper analysis:  
   (1) Discuss the impact of different algorithms on the two types of optimal results;  
   (2) Consider the time delay effects between straight-line motion and turning;  
   (3) Expand the discussion to include deformed or irregular obstacles and their influence on optimal results;  
   (4) Qualitatively analyze the effects of moving obstacles or target points, or discuss 3D spatial scenarios.

[Note] These guidelines are for reference only. Each regional evaluation committee should conduct grading independently based on their understanding of the problem and student solutions.  
This problem mainly has two solution approaches.  

**Method 1** primarily involves first determining the maximum number of finished product bundles for three specifications, then establishing different casing length combinations for each bundle. Specific steps:  
1. Establish integer programming models under constraints of existing three specifications' raw material lengths and quantities to maximize finished product bundles, solved using software.  
2. Build combinatorial or optimization models to calculate different raw material combinations per bundle for each specification obtained in Step 1.  
3. Adjust combinations from Step 2 according to appropriate rules to maximize the number of bundles containing the longest minimum-length products.  
These three steps must be complete, with clear models and reasonable/practical algorithms.  

**Method 2** focuses on first computing all possible raw material combinations for three specifications, then maximizing total bundles while determining bundling patterns. Specific steps:  
1. Use combinatorial methods to calculate all possible raw material combinations for each specification. The combinatorial model must explicitly reflect root number constraints, total length constraints with permissible errors. Algorithm rationality and implementability are crucial.  
2. Establish and solve integer programming models for optimal combination selections across specifications to maximize total bundles. Ensure correct modeling of raw material quantity constraints.  

For both methods: First prioritize bundling longest materials (third specification). Remaining materials should be downgraded for secondary-longest specification bundling. Further remaining materials should be downgraded for shortest specification bundling.  ",Systems & Control,Industrial,"**Redundant Information Identification** (10 points):
