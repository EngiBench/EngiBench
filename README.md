# EngiBench

**EngiBench** is a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on **real-world engineering problem-solving**. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus narrowly on well-posed mathematical tasks, EngiBench incorporates the complexity, ambiguity, and trade-offs inherent in engineering practice.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

* **Three-Level Hierarchical Design**

  * **Level 1**: Foundational knowledge retrieval
  * **Level 2**: Contextual reasoning
  * **Level 3**: Open-ended modeling and decision-making

* **Four Core Capabilities Assessed**

  * Information Extraction
  * Domain-Specific Reasoning
  * Multi-Objective Decision-Making
  * Uncertainty Handling

* **Problem Variants for Robustness and Capability Diagnosis**
  Each problem is systematically rewritten into three versions:

  * *Perturbed*: for robustness analysis
  * *Knowledge-Enhanced*: to test domain understanding
  * *Math Abstraction*: to isolate core reasoning ability

* **Cross-Disciplinary Coverage**
  Spans three major engineering subfields:

  * Systems & Control
  * Physical & Structural
  * Chemical & Biological

* **Rigorous Evaluation Protocols**

  * Binary scoring for Levels 1 & 2
  * Rubric-based scoring for Level 3
  * Human expert comparisons included
